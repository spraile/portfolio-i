            I am Allen Zantua. I first learned about my passion for programming
            in the late years of my Mechanical Engineering degree. That was when
            I realized that I don't want to be on the consumer side, but on the
            creator side instead. That was why I pursued a career on software
            development after finishing my degree. I also learned 3-D modeling
            during my free time to sate my creative impulses. Now, I'm
            undergoing training in Zuitt to learn about Full Stack Development.

          <p>
            I finished a degree in Mechanical Engineering in UP Diliman. Our
            capstone project was powerplant design, wherein my team designed a
            gasifier to produce 3 kilowatts of electricity from waterlily
            leaves. It was a success and we were able to produce 3.2 kW of
            electricity during our final testing. Another student and I also
            designed and prototyped a freesbie launcher for our machine design
            class. After graduating, I took the board exams for Mechanical
            Engineers and passed.
